The main takeaway I would have would be that, despite some government restrictions, it is mainly up to the data collectors on what they decide to do with your online data, either choosing to protect it or exploit it.  An example of this would be the contrast between Apple and Facebook, where Apple has made many attempts to improve user privacy and protect data harvesting.  On the other hand, Facebook was found in the Facebook-Cambridge analytica scandal to have been harvesting user data without permission in order to influence political outcomes.  Simply just from surface level research, I have found that data privacy is an extremely serious topic, one that can be slightly unnerving knowing that some data that may not even be known to me could be taken and used against me or others without my knowing."
